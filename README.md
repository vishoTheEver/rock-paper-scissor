# Rock-Paper-Scissors: A Classic Game with a Pythonic Twist!

Embark on a nostalgic journey with the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, now brought to life through the elegance and simplicity of Python. With colorful ASCII art visuals and a straightforward user interface, this rendition of the age-old game promises a delightful and engaging user experience.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To plunge into the gameplay, ensure that you have Python installed on your system. Clone this repository and navigate to the directory containing the game files. Execute the `main.py` file by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. **Choose Wisely**: Upon running the program, you'll be prompted to make a choice: Rock (0), Paper (1), Scissors (2), or 'q' to quit the game. Type the corresponding number or letter and hit Enter.
   
2. **Behold the Outcome**: The game reveals the choices in artistic ASCII art, determines the winner, and displays the updated score.

3. **Proceed or Farewell**: To engage in another round, press Enter and repeat the steps above. To exit, press 'q' anytime you're prompted to make a choice.

## 🎨 Theme: Python & Rock-Paper-Scissors

The amalgamation of Python's simplicity with the timeless charm of Rock-Paper-Scissors brings forth an engaging yet simple gaming experience. The code employs Python's robust standard libraries, enabling the seamless functioning of the game and enhancing user interaction through colorful visuals (thanks to the Colorama library) and intuitive navigation.
